 * ### Variables declaration  ###
 * Note: The data are stored into the dataRAM of the channel 1.
 *#define Ipeak 5;       ** The peak current value is stored in the Data RAM address 5
 *#define Ihold 6;       * * The hold current value is stored in the Data RAM address 6
 *#define Thold_off 7;  *  * The hold off time is stored in the Data RAM address 7
 *#define Thold_tot 8; ** The hold phase duration is stored in the Data RAM address 8
 
 
 * Note: The Tpeak_tot variable defines the current profile time out. The active STARTx pin is expected to toggle in is low state before this time out.
